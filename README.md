# Popol Wuj
This is a TEI-encoded CTS-compliant version of the Popol Wuj

## What is the Popol Wuj?
From our [Multepal Project website](http://multepal.spanitalport.virginia.edu/): From the colonial period to the present day, the Popol Wuj, sometimes called the K'iche' Maya book of creation, has been translated, edited, paraphrased, and glossed in more than 25 languages. WorldCat suggests that there are over 1,200 known editions of the work, variously published in verse (Colop 2008, Tedlock 1996), poetry (Colop 1999, Christenson 2008), heavily-annotated versions (Christenson 2003, Mondlock and Carmack 2018), and illustrated volumes (Montejo and Garay 2012). Each translation offers a different interpretation of the K’iche’ source text. The opening line of Adrián Recinos’s Spanish-language translation is, “Este es el principio de las antiguas historias de este lugar llamado Quiché” (This is the beginning of the ancient histories of this place called K'iche') while Ermilo Abreu Gómez renders it as, “Entonces no había ni gente, ni animales, ni árboles, ni piedras, ni nada” (And so there were neither people, nor animals, nor trees, nor stones, or anything).

## What is CTS?
From "A New Implementation for Canonical Text Services" (Tiepmar et. al 2014: 1): Canonical Text Services (CTS) (Smith, 2009) is a standard that resulted from research in the Digital Humanities community on citation in a digital context. It consists of two parts: an URN scheme that is used to express citations and a protocol for the interaction of a client and a server to identify text passages and retrieve them.

CTS is an attempt to formalize citation practices which allow for a persistent identification of text passages and citations which express an ontology of texts as well as links between texts (Smith and Blackwell, 2012). The same citation scheme can be used across different versions of a text, even across language borders.

All these properties make CTS attractive as an approach to the presentation of large, structured collections of texts. The frame-work will have little impact however as long as there is no implementation that can scale to the amount of texts currently available for Digital Humanities research and still perform at a level that makes automatic processing of texts attractive. Therefore the implementation of the scheme presented here allows for large repositories without becoming infeasibly slow.
